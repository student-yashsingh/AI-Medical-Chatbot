Lactose intolerance, the\\ninability to digest the sugar found in milk, is widespread\\nand affects up to 70% of the world’s adult population.\\nDescription\\nCarbohydrates are the primary source of energy and,\\nalong with fats and proteins, one of the three major nutri-\\nents in the human diet. Carbohydrates are classified\\naccording to their structure based on the number of basic\\nsugar, or saccharide units they contain.\\nA monosaccharide is the simplest carbohydrate and\\ncalled a simple sugar.

These simple sugars are important\\nbecause they can be absorbed by the small intestine. Two\\nsimple sugars linked together make a disaccharide. The\\ndisaccharide sugars present in the diet are maltose (a\\nproduct of the digestion of starch), sucrose (table sugar),\\nand lactose (the sugar in milk). These disaccharides must\\nbe broken down by enzymes into two simple sugars so\\nthat they can be absorbed by the intestine. Polysaccha-\\nrides are much more complex carbohydrates made up of\\nmany simple sugars, the most important of which are\\nglycogen, which is stored in the liver, and starch.\\nDigestion of sugars\\nDigestion of food begins in the mouth, moves on to\\nthe stomach, and then into the small intestine.

Primary deficiency is caused by an enzyme defect\\npresent at birth or developed over time. The most common\\nis lactose intolerance.

The ciliary body\\ncontains muscles that help in the eye’s focusing ability.\\nThe lens lies behind the pupil and iris. It is covered by a\\ncellophane-like capsule. The lens is normally transparent,\\nelliptical in shape, and somewhat elastic. This elasticity\\nallows the lens to focus on both near and far objects. The\\nlens is attached to the ciliary body by fibers (zonules of\\nZinn). Muscles in the ciliary body act on the zonules,\\nwhich then change the shape of the lens. This process is\\ncalled accommodation—the lens focuses images to help\\nmake vision clear. As people age, the lens hardens and\\nchanges shape less easily. As a result, the accommodation\\nprocess becomes more difficult, making it harder to see\\nthings up close. This generally occurs around the age of 40'),\n",

Changes in the proteins, water\\ncontent, enzymes, and other chemicals are some of the\\nreasons for the formation of a cataract.\\nThe major areas of the lens are the nucleus, the cor-\\ntex, and the capsule.

Manufac-\\ntured chiefly by the chromaffin cells of the adrenal\\nglands, these hormones are involved in readying the body\\nfor the “fight-or-flight” response (also known as the alarm\\nreaction). When these hormones are released, the heart\\nbeats stronger and faster, blood pressure rises, more blood\\nflows to the brain and muscles, the liver releases stores of\\nenergy as a sugar the body can readily use (glucose), the\\nrate of breathing increases and airways widen, and diges-\\ntive activity slows.

The saccular\\naneurysm, once called a berry aneurysm, resembles a piece\\nof fruit dangling from a branch. Saccular aneurysms are\\nusually found at a branch in the blood vessel where they\\nballoon out by a thin neck. Saccular cerebral aneurysms\\nmost often occur at the branch points of large arteries at the\\nbase of the brain.

There-\\nfore, knowledge about CMT has increased dramatically\\nwithin a short time.\\nThe peripheral nerves\\nCMT affects the peripheral nerves, those groups of\\nnerve cells carrying information to and from the spinal\\ncord. CMT decreases the ability of these nerves to carry\\nmotor commands to muscles, especially those furthest\\nfrom the spinal cord located in the feet and hands. As a\\nresult, the muscles connected to these nerves eventually\\nweaken. CMT also affects the sensory nerves that carry\\ninformation from the limbs to the brain. Therefore peo-\\nple with CMT also have sensory loss. This causes symp-\\ntoms such as not being able to tell if something is hot or\\ncold or difficulties with balance.\\nThere are two parts of the nerve that can be affected\\nin CMT.

A nerve can be likened to an electrical wire, in\\nwhich the wire part is the axon of the nerve and the insu-\\nlation surrounding it is the myelin sheath.

People who have problems\\nwith the myelin have CMT type 1 and people who have\\nabnormalities of the axon have CMT type 2.\\nSpecialized testing of the nerves, called nerve con-\\nduction testing (NCV), can be performed to determine if\\na person has CMT1 or CMT2. These tests measure the\\nspeed at which messages travel through the nerves.

Genes contain the instructions for how\\nthe body grows and develops before and after a person is\\nborn. There are probably at least 15 different genes that\\ncan cause CMT. However, as of early 2001, many have\\nnot yet been identified.\\nCMT types 1 and 2 can be broken down into sub-\\ntypes based upon the gene that is causing CMT. The sub-\\ntypes are labeled by letters, so there is CMT1A, CMT1B,\\netc. Therefore, the gene with a mutation that causes\\nCMT1A is different from that that causes CMT1B.\\nTypes of CMT\\nCMT1A.

In most people\\nwho have CMT, the mutation that causes the condition is\\na duplication (doubling) of the PMP22 gene. Instead of\\nhaving two copies of the PMP22 gene (one on each chro-\\nmosome) there are three copies. It is not known how this\\nextra copy of the PMP22 gene causes the observed symp-\\ntoms.

The job of this gene is\\nto make the layers of myelin stick together as they are\\nwrapped around the axon.

Thus the body has\\nthe innate intelligence to heal itself when unencumbered\\nby spinal irregularities causing nerve interference.

How-\\never, some may need to use cholesterol-reducing drugs to\\nreduce their risk of health problems.\\nDescription\\nThere are four different classes of cholesterol lower-\\ning drugs:\\nBile acid sequesterants are drugs that act by binding\\nwith the bile produced by the liver. Bile helps the diges-\\ntion and absorption of fats in the intestine. By blocking\\nthe digestion of fats, bile acid sequesterants prevent the\\nformation of cholesterol. Drugs in this class include:\\ncholestyramine (Questran); colestipol (Colestid); and\\ncolesevalam (Welchol).\\nHMG-CoA inhibitors, often called “statins,” are\\ndrugs that block an enzyme called “3-hydroxy-3-methyl-\\nglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase.” This blocks one of the\\nsteps in converting fat to cholesterol.

Drugs in\\nthis group include: atorvastatin (Lipitor); cerivastatin\\n(Baycol); fluvastatin (Lescol); lovastatin (Mevacor);\\npravastatin (Pravachol); and simvastatin (Zocor).\\nFibric acid derivatives include clofibrate (Atromid-\\nS); gemfibrozil (Lopid); and fenofibrate (Tricor).\\nAlthough these drugs are less effective than the statins at\\nlowering total cholesterol, they may be able to lower the\\nlow-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol while raising\\nthe high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.
